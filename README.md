Implementation: Concurrent games (100 points)

NETIDS(bp535, flk16)


Test plan:
Our testplan was to make a demo client that would allow us to connect to the server and play the game. We would then test 
the game by playing and using the features that we had just implemented and making sure that they worked. We would use 
multiple instances of a terminal to be able to run multiple clients at once so we could test the concurrent games.
